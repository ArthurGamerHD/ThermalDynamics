"""Whether a derived cruise speed lands where the authored one does, on real ships.

[RelativeTopSpeed](https://github.com/Gauge/RelativeTopSpeed) holds each grid under a *cruise
speed* interpolated through three authored mass points per grid size — eight numbers and two
multipliers, fitted by hand. It has no air in it at all: no density, no altitude, no area, no shape,
so a hull and a brick of the same mass decelerate identically.

**This model has every one of those terms already**, so the same quantity falls out instead of being
fitted: a ship cruises where its thrust balances its drag, `T = ½ C_d ρ A v²`, which is

    v_cruise = sqrt(2T / (C_d ρ A))

and needs no mass at all. That is the whole argument of thermal-model.md's change log, the grid-speed milestone, and the row says exactly
what decides it: **whether the derived speeds land where the authored ones do on real ships**. This
is that measurement.

**It needs thrust and exposed area and nothing else**, both of which the census carries, so it costs
a parse rather than a walk. Ships with neither — stations, unpowered hulks — are counted and
dropped rather than given a speed they do not have (`E8`).
