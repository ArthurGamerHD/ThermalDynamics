    refusing 1.15x of a demand costs 0.03 K on the hottest block over 600 simulated seconds, and
    the approximation stays under a tenth of a kelvin out to 1.5x on every hull shape measured.
    Past that the sweep has no figure, and this says so rather than extrapolating (`P2`).

    **The marker itself is deliberately left where it was written** (`E11`). This is a line beside
    the verdict so a reader can see the size of what failed; it is not a relaxation of what fails.
