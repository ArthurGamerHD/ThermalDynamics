"""**The two readers of the provenance grammar agree**, which is the only thing that keeps them
from drifting apart in silence (`D3`).

`AuthoredWasteTests` reads the comment above every waste fraction in `Cubes.xml` to decide whether
a value is sourced, derived, unreachable or invented, and pins the four counts. `provenance.py`
reads the same comments to weight a census by them. Two parsers of one format drift in both
directions, so the counts this file asserts are the counts that test asserts, written out here so
that moving one without the other fails.
