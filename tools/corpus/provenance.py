"""**How much of the heat a fleet makes rests on a number nobody sourced.**

`Cubes.xml` states a waste fraction per block type, and since [backlog.md](../../docs/backlog.md)
2026-08-23 each one says where it came from: a conversion in `ReferenceEfficiencies`, a field the
game's own definition states, a note that nothing reads it, or an admitted invention. Counting those says
how much of the *file* is sourced. It does not say how much of the *heat* is, and those are very
different numbers, because one block type carries most of a fleet's waste on its own.

This reads a census `composition.csv` — per ship, per subtype, the watts it wastes at full
electrical load — and reports both.

    python3 tools/corpus/provenance.py out/census-2026-08-21/composition.csv
    python3 tools/corpus/provenance.py out/census-2026-08-21/composition.csv --type OxygenGenerator

The second form asks the other question, and the two disagree by two orders of magnitude on the
same type. The first is a ratio of aggregates and says how much of *a fleet's* heat rests on an
unsourced number; the second is an aggregate of ratios over the ships that carry the type, and says
how much of *their* heat does. The oxygen generator is 0.38 % of the first and a median 48 % of
the second, and only the second is a figure about the player who built one (`E6`).

Two things it states rather than hides. The population is whatever the census walked and the basis
is **full electrical load with every jump drive charging**, which is a bound rather than a duty
cycle (`E3`); and a census taken before a fraction moved measured the old one, so the drives are
restated as a second column with the two values named here rather than silently rescaled.

The note grammar is parsed here and in `AuthoredWasteTests`, which is two readers of one format
(`D3`). `test_provenance.py` pins the four counts against the ones that test pins, so the two
cannot drift apart quietly.
