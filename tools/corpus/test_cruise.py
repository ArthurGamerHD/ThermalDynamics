"""**A derived cruise speed, and the ways the derivation could be quietly wrong.**

the grid-speed milestone's argument is that a top speed does not have to be authored: a ship cruises where its thrust
balances its drag, which this model has every term of. The question the row says decides it is
whether the derived speeds land where the authored ones do on real ships — measured by `cruise.py`
over the census, and pinned here at the level of the arithmetic.

The rules argued here are stated canonically in [rules.md](../../docs/rules.md): `E8` `E5`.
