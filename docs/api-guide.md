# Building on Thermal Dynamics from another mod

What this page covers: how to bind another Space Engineers mod or in-game script to Thermal
Dynamics' API and drive it — the setup, the binding lifecycle, a worked task for each system, and
the multiplayer and threading rules that decide where a call is safe to make. It is the *guide*;
[api.md](api.md) is the *reference* — the exact key-by-key contract, its version rule, and its
guarantees. Where the two overlap, api.md is authoritative on signatures and this page is
authoritative on how to use them.

| Looking for | Go to |
| --- | --- |
| The exact delegate for one key | [api.md](api.md) |
| What a value means physically | [thermal-model.md](thermal-model.md) |
| The settings a call addresses by name | [configuration.md](configuration.md) |
| Extending the core in-process, past the message API | [api.md](api.md#in-process-extension) |

## What the API is, in one paragraph

Space Engineers mods cannot reference one another's compiled assemblies, so Thermal Dynamics
publishes its surface as a `Dictionary<string, Delegate>` sent over a mod-message channel. You
register a handler on the channel, receive the dictionary, and cast the delegates you want to
their documented `Func<...>` types. Every delegate uses only whitelisted types, so an in-game
Programmable Block script binds the same way a mod does. Nothing you call throws into your code,
and nothing you do reaches the simulation except through these delegates.

* **Channel:** `2985582372` (the mod's workshop id — it cannot collide)
* **Payload:** `Dictionary<string, Delegate>`
* **Version:** `1`

## Setup

### 1. A minimal consumer

This is a complete session component that binds at load and one field it uses. Everything else in
this guide is a variation on it.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Sandbox.ModAPI;
using VRage.Game;
using VRage.Game.Components;
using VRage.Game.ModAPI;
using VRage.ModAPI;
using VRageMath;

[MySessionComponentDescriptor(MyUpdateOrder.NoUpdate)]
public class ThermalConsumer : MySessionComponentBase
{
    private const long ThermalChannel = 2985582372;
    private const int RequiredMajor = 1;

    private Dictionary<string, Delegate> api;
    private Func<IMySlimBlock, float> getTemperature;

    public override void LoadData()
    {
        MyAPIGateway.Utilities.RegisterMessageHandler(ThermalChannel, OnThermalApi);

        // Ask for the table, in case Thermal Dynamics loaded before us and its one-time
        // broadcast has already gone out. Any non-dictionary payload is treated as a request,
        // so null is fine, and re-requesting is idempotent.
        MyAPIGateway.Utilities.SendModMessage(ThermalChannel, null);
    }

    protected override void UnloadData()
    {
        MyAPIGateway.Utilities.UnregisterMessageHandler(ThermalChannel, OnThermalApi);
        api = null;
        getTemperature = null;
    }

    private void OnThermalApi(object payload)
    {
        var table = payload as Dictionary<string, Delegate>;
        if (table == null) return;   // our own request echoing back, or someone else's

        var version = table["ApiVersion"] as Func<int>;
        if (version == null || version() != RequiredMajor) return;   // not a build we understand

        api = table;
        getTemperature = api["GetBlockTemperature"] as Func<IMySlimBlock, float>;
    }
}
```

### 2. The three things that setup gets wrong

* **Binding too early.** If you cast delegates in `LoadData` before the table has arrived, they
  are null. Bind in the message handler, as above, and treat "not yet bound" as a normal state
  your code tolerates until `OnThermalApi` fires.
* **Not requesting.** Thermal Dynamics broadcasts once at session start. If you loaded after that,
  the broadcast is gone and you will wait forever unless you send a request. Always send one in
  `LoadData`.
* **Not null-checking the cast.** A key you did not expect, a delegate whose signature changed
  across a major, or a build that does not carry a key all produce **null** from the `as` cast,
  never an exception. Test for null after every cast and after every `ApiVersion` check.

### 3. Hold the delegates, or hold the table

Either works. Casting once in the handler and holding the `Func<...>` fields (as above) is
marginally faster and makes a missing key obvious at bind time. Holding the whole dictionary and
casting at each call site is fine too — the cast is cheap — and is easier when you use many keys.
Do not, however, cache a *return value* across frames: temperatures, forces and loop states are
live and change every step.

## Versioning: bind defensively

Read `ApiVersion` first and refuse a major you were not written against. The major moves only when
a caller written against the previous major could bind and then be wrong — a key removed, a
signature changed, or a meaning changed without the signature. A key that is merely *added* does
not move it, so a newer Thermal Dynamics than you were built against still satisfies a correct
`== RequiredMajor` consumer, and you simply will not see the keys added since. Never test `>=` on
the major: a higher major is, by definition, one your casts may now get wrong.

## The tasks

Every snippet below assumes `api` is the bound dictionary from setup. Signatures are copied from
[api.md](api.md); if they ever disagree, the reference wins.

### Read a block's heat

```csharp
var getThermals = api["GetBlockThermals"]
    as Func<IMySlimBlock, MyTuple<float, float, float, int>>;

var t = getThermals(block);
float kelvin       = t.Item1;   // temperature
float heatCapacity = t.Item2;   // J/K
float critical     = t.Item3;   // K, or 0 if the block has no critical limit
int   exposedFaces = t.Item4;   // faces open to the environment
```

A block that is not simulated — excluded by definition, on a grid without physics, or not yet
registered — reads as all zeros rather than throwing. There is no "is this block simulated" call;
a zero heat capacity is the signal, since a real block never has one.

### Read a grid

`GetGridSummary` is the cheap overview; `GetGridHeatBalance` is the thermal budget.

```csharp
var summary = api["GetGridSummary"] as Func<IMyCubeGrid, MyTuple<float, float, int, int>>;
var s = summary(grid);   // hottest block K, ambient K, blocks over critical, coolant loop count

var balance = api["GetGridHeatBalance"] as Func<IMyCubeGrid, MyTuple<float, float>>;
var b = balance(grid);   // watts vented, watts generated  (equal when the ship is in balance)
```

`GetGridFrictionWatts` is one term *inside* the second figure of `GetGridHeatBalance`, not a third
number — add them and you count friction twice.

### Add and control heat sources

A point source radiates like a small sun: `P / (4π r²)` resolved at each grid, weighted by which
faces look at it. Bind a source to an entity and it disappears with the entity — no cleanup on a
projectile or a burning wreck.

```csharp
var addSource    = api["AddHeatSource"]    as Func<IMyEntity, float, float, int>;
var updateSource = api["UpdateHeatSource"] as Func<int, float, bool>;
var removeSource = api["RemoveHeatSource"] as Func<int, bool>;

int id = addSource(missile, 5e6f, 300f);   // 5 MW, felt out to 300 m; 0 means it was not added
updateSource(id, 2e6f);                    // throttle it down
removeSource(id);                          // or drop it (unnecessary if the entity dies)
```

Keep `range` to the distance the effect should actually be felt: every source within range of a
grid costs that grid one pass over its exposed blocks per step (this is `D25` on
[redesign.md](redesign.md) — the fold that would cut it is designed but conditional on a world
using sources, which yours would be). `AddHeatSourceAt(Vector3D, watts, range)` fixes a source at
a world position instead of following an entity.

### Subscribe to temperature thresholds

Register a temperature once; get called for every block that crosses it, on every grid, including
grids created later.

```csharp
var addThreshold = api["AddThreshold"]
    as Func<float, int, Action<IMySlimBlock, int, float, float, bool>, int>;
var removeThreshold = api["RemoveThreshold"] as Func<int, bool>;

int id = addThreshold(450f, 0, (block, thresholdId, threshold, reached, rising) =>
{
    // 450 K crossed on the way up (direction 0 = rising, 1 = falling, 2 = both)
});
```

The callback is raised once per step, after the step completes, on the server and on clients
alike. **A callback that throws is dropped and logged** — it will not be called again, and one
misbehaving subscriber cannot stall the simulation for the rest. Keep it short and defensive; do
the real work by flagging state your own update loop reads, not inside the callback.

### Read and write settings

Every setting is live: a write takes effect on the next step of every grid.

```csharp
var list = api["ListSettings"] as Func<List<string>>;
var get  = api["GetSetting"]   as Func<string, float>;
var set  = api["SetSetting"]   as Func<string, float, bool>;

float coefficient = get("RoomConvectionCoefficient");   // NaN if there is no such setting
set("EnableSolarSelfShadowing", 1f);                    // switches are 0 and 1; false if unknown
```

`GetSetting` returns `float.NaN` for a name that does not exist (and answers with the defaults, not
zero, if Thermal Dynamics has not finished loading its own config yet). A write is not saved to the
config file — it lasts the session unless an administrator runs `/thermal save`. The names are in
[configuration.md](configuration.md).

### Read a coolant loop

`GetGridSummary` gives the loop count; this reads a loop, keyed on any pipe block in it.

```csharp
var coolantLoop = api["GetCoolantLoop"]
    as Func<IMySlimBlock, MyTuple<bool, float, float, float, int>>;

var loop = coolantLoop(pipeBlock);
if (loop.Item1)   // this block is on a loop
{
    float mean = loop.Item2, hottest = loop.Item3, coldest = loop.Item4;
    int pipeCount = loop.Item5;
    // A working loop has a gradient: it picks heat up at one end and sheds it at the other,
    // so hottest - coldest is the spread the mean hides.
}
```

Key it on a *block*, not a loop index: a topology rebuild reorders the loop list, but the pipe a
player placed is stable.

### Read the aerodynamic forces

`GetGridFrictionWatts` gives the drag *power*; this gives the drag and lift *vectors* in world
newtons, which is what you need to apply a force.

```csharp
var aeroForces = api["GetGridAeroForces"] as Func<IMyCubeGrid, MyTuple<Vector3, Vector3>>;
var f = aeroForces(grid);
Vector3 dragNewtons = f.Item1;   // along the relative wind
Vector3 liftNewtons = f.Item2;   // perpendicular to it
```

Drag is zero unless the friction term is enabled; lift is zero unless both `EnableShapeDrag` and
`EnableLift` are, and zero for a still grid. These are assembled the same way Thermal Dynamics'
own aerodynamics apply them, so if the mod is applying them you are reading the force already on
the grid — apply it again only if you mean to.

### Tell the drag model a block's shape

The drag model's only shape term is a projected area, so it cannot tell a jet nacelle from a box.
If your block is slippery nose-on and blunt side-on, say so with six per-face multipliers.

```csharp
var setDrag   = api["SetBlockDragProfile"]   as Func<IMySlimBlock, float[], bool>;
var clearDrag = api["ClearBlockDragProfile"] as Func<IMySlimBlock, bool>;

setDrag(nacelle, new[] { 0.2f, 0.2f, 1f, 1f, 1f, 1f });   // slippery on the first two faces
```

Exactly six entries in face order, each `0..1`. **A profile may only reduce** — anything over 1,
under 0, or `NaN` is clamped to 1 (no change), because a registration must never throw into the
simulation's loop and *no change* is the direction that cannot break a ship. It touches drag and
the wind's convection, not the sun.

## Multiplayer

Thermal Dynamics simulates on the server and on each client (a client predicts locally rather than
having every temperature replicated to it), and the **server is authoritative over damage**. That
sets where your calls belong:

* **Reads are safe on any machine.** They report that machine's current simulation, which on a
  well-synchronised session is the same everywhere; a freshly joined or hitching client may read a
  value that has not caught up yet.
* **Do authoritative writes on the server.** `SetBlockTemperature`, `AddBlockHeat` and
  `SetRoomPressure` change the local simulation. Called on the server, the change is authoritative
  and reaches clients through the normal path; called only on a client, it will drift from the
  server and may be corrected against you. Guard them with `MyAPIGateway.Multiplayer.IsServer`
  unless you specifically want a client-local cosmetic effect and understand it will not persist.
* **Threshold callbacks fire on both.** A crossing is raised on the server and on clients alike,
  so if you react to one with a world change, gate that change to the server yourself or it happens
  once per machine.
* **Heat sources** registered through the API are local to the machine that registered them; if a
  source should exist for everyone, register it on every machine (e.g. in a component that runs on
  both), or register it on the server and let the heat it produces replicate as temperature.

## Threading and timing

* **No call requires a particular thread or update phase.** Call from any update order; the API
  does not touch the simulation's stepping schedule.
* **Nothing is required to be called every frame.** Bind once, call when you have reason to.
* **Return values are per-step live.** A temperature or a force read this frame is this frame's;
  do not cache it across frames.

## Guarantees you can rely on

These are stated in full, and enforced, in [api.md](api.md#guarantees). In short:

* No call throws into you. A bad argument or an internal failure returns the type's default —
  `false`, `0`, `NaN`, an empty tuple — and the exception is recorded in Thermal Dynamics'
  telemetry, not yours.
* Keys do not change meaning within a major version. New keys may appear; a missing key means an
  older build, so test for null after casting.
* Every signature uses whitelisted types, so a Programmable Block script binds exactly as a mod
  does.

## When the message API is not enough

A mod willing to couple to Thermal Dynamics' source, rather than only its message table, can drive
the simulation core directly — it has no dependency on the game session and its seams
(`IBlockAdjacency`, `ThermalSimulation`) are meant to be used. That path, and its cost, is in
[api.md](api.md#in-process-extension).

## Change log

| Date | Change |
| --- | --- |
| 2026-09-05 | Written, alongside an audit that added `GetGridAeroForces` and `GetCoolantLoop` to close the two shipped systems that had no read accessor. Covers setup, the binding lifecycle, a task per system, and the multiplayer and threading rules; the key-by-key contract stays in [api.md](api.md). |
