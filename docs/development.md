## Prerequisites

* Space Engineers installed (the project references DLLs from `Bin64/` directly).
* .NET Framework 4.7.2 targeting pack, or a Mono/MSBuild setup that can target `net472`.
* The mod's own runtime dependencies for testing in game: Definition Extensions
  (`2756894170`) and Rich HUD Master (`1965654081`).

## Building

`Generic.csproj` / `Generic.sln` exist **only to get IntelliSense and compiler errors**. Space
Engineers compiles `Data/Scripts/**/*.cs` itself at world load; the produced `Generic.dll` is
not shipped or loaded.

**It is a member of `tests/Thermodynamics.slnx`, so the suite's own build compiles it** — building
the test solution is what checks the mod, and `rules.md` `C11` is why. The test projects link
`Core/` and a handful of adapter files; everything else that touches the game's assemblies is
compiled here and nowhere else, so leaving this project out of the build made a rename in `Core`
invisible until a world load.

```bash
dotnet build tests/Thermodynamics.slnx      # everything, mod project included
dotnet build Generic.csproj -c Release      # the mod project alone
```

Every `<HintPath>` resolves through `$(SEBinPath)`, which
[Directory.Build.props](../Directory.Build.props) locates: `SE_BIN` if it is set, then the default
Steam install on Linux, then the one on Windows. If none of them exists the build says so by name
rather than producing an unresolved reference per assembly:

```bash
SE_BIN=/path/to/SpaceEngineers/Bin64 dotnet build tests/Thermodynamics.slnx
```

Two things about that reference set are easy to get wrong:

* **Target `net48`, not `net472`.** `VRage.Platform.Windows` and its RestSharp dependency are
  built against .NET Framework 4.8; at 4.7.2 they silently fail to resolve.
* **Do not reference `VRage.Native.dll`.** It is unmanaged and produces
  `MSB3246: PE image does not have metadata`.

XML documentation ships next to the DLLs for `Sandbox.Game`, `VRage.Game`, `VRage` and others,
so IntelliSense will show the engine's own docs once the references resolve. See
[engine-notes.md](engine-notes.md) for a survey of what is available.
[.gitignore](../.gitignore) drops `bin/`, `obj/`, `.vs/` and `out/`; it lists `*.csproj`, `*.sln`
and `*.props` and then un-ignores them again, because the mod project and the test projects are
both built from checked-in files.

Constraints that matter when writing code for this project:

* **C# 6 only** (`<LangVersion>6</LangVersion>`). No tuples, no `switch` expressions, no
  string interpolation beyond what C# 6 supports, no `out var`.
* Space Engineers' script whitelist applies: no reflection, no file I/O outside
  `MyAPIGateway.Utilities`, no threading. The solver is order-independent by
  construction, so it could be parallelised if the whitelist ever allowed it.
* **The whitelist covers exception types too**, and this is easy to miss because the local build
  and `tests/` both accept them — only the in-game compiler rejects them, at world load. Confirmed
  prohibited: `IndexOutOfRangeException`, `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`. Confirmed allowed:
  `Exception`, `ArgumentException`, `ArgumentNullException`, `InvalidOperationException`,
  `FormatException`. Prefer bounds-checking over catching an out-of-range throw — see
  `ThermalStorageCodec.TryDecodeVersion2`, which validates each record count against the
  remaining payload rather than reading and catching.
* Anything that allocates per frame will show up. The existing code pools the raycast result
  lists (`_overlapResultPool`, `_gridPool`) and caches `kA` arrays for this reason.

### Testing

The simulation core under [Data/Scripts/Thermodynamics/Core/](../Data/Scripts/Thermodynamics/Core)
ships with the mod — the game compiles it — and the projects under [tests/](../tests) link the same
files so it can be built, tested and profiled outside the game. What each of them is, how to run the
suite and how to run the scenarios and benchmarks is [tests/README.md](../tests/README.md).

## Deploying to the game

Space Engineers loads local mods from its `Mods` directory. On Windows, junction this folder into
`%AppData%/SpaceEngineers/Mods`. On Linux, symlink it:

```bash
ln -s /home/gauge/Content/git/SpaceEngineers/One/ThermalDynamics \
      ~/.local/share/SpaceEngineers/Mods/ThermalDynamics
```

Then enable "ThermalDynamics" in the world's mod list alongside the two dependencies.

Script changes take effect on world reload. Definition XML changes also require a reload.

## Repository layout

```

Two things in that tree are not to be touched: `Models/` is not restructured, and the workshop
identity files are not regenerated. Both have their own sections below.

## Repo conventions

* This repository *is* the mod folder: the game loads it directly, so anything committed here is
  published to the workshop. Build output and the blueprint corpus are kept outside it — see
  [Directory.Build.props](../Directory.Build.props), which sends `bin/` and `obj/` to a sibling
  `ThermalDynamics.build/`.
* [metadata.mod](../metadata.mod) and [modinfo.sbmi](../modinfo.sbmi) carry the workshop
  identity — `modinfo.sbmi` holds the Steam workshop id `2985582372`. Do not regenerate them,
  or the mod will publish as a new item.

## Documentation conventions

Every page under `docs/`, and every README, follows one shape. The point is that a reader can pick
up any page and know where to look, and that a page cannot quietly become a historical document
while still reading as a description of the code.

1. **A title, then one paragraph saying what the page covers and what it does not.** A page that
   cannot state its scope in a paragraph is two pages.
2. **A rules banner where the page argues a standing rule**, citing it by identifier — the rule is
   stated canonically in [rules.md](rules.md) and argued at length here, never the other way round.
3. **A "Looking for / Go to" table** where a reader might reasonably be on the wrong page. This is
   what stops the same subject being explained twice in two places.
4. **The body in the present tense**, describing what the code does now. **Not** what it used to do,
   what was tried, or what a past session found. **Two things read like history and are not**, and
   both stay: a measurement's before/after table is present-tense evidence, and a correction to
   something this repository published has to sit where the wrong figure sat, naming what it said
   (`E10`). What goes is the narrative around them — *this section used to be organised differently*,
   *that field is gone now*. Swept 2026-08-25: thirty-six sentences in page bodies still say *used
   to* and every one is a correction or a before/after; the seven that were neither are rewritten.
5. **Most important information first.** What the thing *is* precedes how it was arrived at; the
   evidence and the engine survey that justify a model come after the model.
6. **A `## Change log` last**, newest first, one row per date: `| Date | Change |`. This is the only
   place historical revisions belong. Entries record what changed and why, including corrections to
   things this repository previously published — a finding corrected somewhere other than where it
   was published is not corrected (`E10`).

Checks that hold this in place: `EveryDocumentIsInTheIndex`, `EveryPageHasAChangeLog`,
`EveryRelativeLinkResolves`, `EveryAnchorNamesAHeading`, `NoPageNamesATestThatHasBeenRenamed`,
`EveryQuotedSuiteSizeIsCurrent`, `EveryRuleCitedByAPageExists`,
`TheRulesPageIndexesEveryRuleItStates` and `EveryCitedIdentifierResolves` — the last of which reads
`.cs` and `.py` files rather than markdown, because a rule or a backlog row cited in a comment is
a reference that rots exactly like a dead link and nothing was reading those.

### And in the code

A comment follows the same split, stated in
[document-of-intent.md](document-of-intent.md#what-a-code-comment-is-for) and held by `R14`: it
**names** the definition it sits on, and where it would argue, it names the page that argues.

Write that pointer as plain text — `See stiffness.md, A per-block substep cap.` — and never as a
relative markdown link. A link inside a `.cs` file renders nowhere, so nobody clicks it and nothing
notices when it breaks; `EveryAnchorNamesAHeading` reads markdown only. Both of the two that existed
in the tree had rotted, one of them into a directory that does not exist.

**This is `R16` and it is checked now.** It was a convention nothing enforced for three days and 155
more links accumulated across 91 files in that time, including one in `Settings.cs` pointing four
directories above where it sat. `NoPointerInCodeIsWrittenAsALink` fails on any of them.

The exception is a **test class summary**, which `R10` makes the canonical statement of what that
class is for — "in its own summary, not in an index". There is no page to move it to, so it stays
where it is.

**And the two-line limit is about a comment inside a body, not about a summary.** Measured over the
tree: 2,347 running `//` comments, 73 % of them one or two lines and 72 over five — the limit
describes those, and they are the ones that rot, because they sit beside code that moves. The 4,838
`///` summaries run to 24,380 lines and 62 % are longer than two lines; a summary sits on a name,
which does not move under it, and the longest of them carry an experiment's controls. The test on a
summary is `R14`'s: does it state what the thing is, or argue what a page argues?

## Do not restructure `Models/`

Both [note.txt](../note.txt) and [Models/note.txt](../Models/note.txt) say the same thing:

> don't change the folder structure of /models/ otherwise the block LODs break.

LOD and build-stage model paths are baked into the `.mwm` binaries at export time. Moving or
renaming a folder under `Models/` silently breaks LOD switching in game, and the only fix is
re-exporting the models.

Naming pattern under `Models/Gauge/{LG,SG}/`:

| Suffix | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 2026-08-25 | Said which two things read like history and stay — a before/after measurement, and an `E10` correction sitting where the wrong figure sat — because a flat *present tense only* reading of this convention deletes exactly the evidence the rules require. Also scoped the two-line comment limit to a comment inside a body, measured. |
| 2026-08-22 | Took the repository layout tree and the build-and-test instructions off the [README](../README.md), which is written to be pasted into the workshop and read by a player ([backlog.md](backlog.md) `H5`). Nothing in them was wrong; they were in the wrong place, and the documentation index moved to [docs/README.md](README.md) for the same reason. |
| *(none)* | Full-detail model |
| `_LOD1` … `_LOD3` | Progressively lower detail |
| `_BS1` … `_BS3` | Build-stage models, referenced from `<BuildProgressModels>` |

## Vendored third-party code

Do not hand-edit these; replace them wholesale when the upstream author publishes a new version.

| Path | Upstream |
| --- | --- |
| [RichHudFramework/](../Data/Scripts/Thermodynamics/RichHudFramework) | Zach Hembree's Rich HUD Framework client module |
| [DefinitionExtensionsAPI.cs](../Data/Scripts/Thermodynamics/DefinitionExtensionsAPI.cs) | Draygo's Definition Extensions client |
| [NetworkAPI/](../Data/Scripts/Thermodynamics/NetworkAPI) | SENetworkAPI |

## Scenarios

The harness in [tests/](../tests) runs the model without the game. `dotnet run --project
tests/Thermodynamics.Sim -- list` names them; `run <name|all>` runs them, `--csv <dir>` writes the
full series.

Each one states a conclusion in its summary line, and
[ScenarioClaimTests](../tests/Thermodynamics.Tests/ScenarioClaimTests.cs) and
[SelfShadowScenarioTests](../tests/Thermodynamics.Tests/SelfShadowScenarioTests.cs) assert those
conclusions cannot quietly invert — a scenario whose headline can flip is worse than none, because
it reads like evidence.

Two are about the sun rather than about heat flow:

| Scenario | Answers |
| --- | --- |
| `self-shadow` | Which faces of a solid slab are lit, as a share per direction, with a recess cut into it. Its claim test recomputes the same shares by ray-versus-cube against the same geometry, so the scenario cannot agree with a model that has drifted. |
| `shadow-cost` | What self-shadowing costs: the per-tick cost with the walk idle, and the cost of a whole pass, best of three each. Its claim test fails if the walk ever migrates onto the stepping path. |

## Debugging

* **In game:** the debug toggles in [configuration.md](configuration.md#presentation) cover
  temperature, solar intensity, exposed surfaces, friction, and the solar/wind rays. The
  crosshair readout in [Debug.cs](../Data/Scripts/Thermodynamics/Debug.cs) dumps a block's full
  thermal state including raw surface bits.
* **Logs:** everything logs to the SE log with the `[Thermodynamics]` prefix via
  `MyLog.Default.Info`.
* **Timing:** switch telemetry on with `/thermal telemetry on` and take a report with
  `/thermal dump`. The cost section breaks the update into topology rebuild, room mapping,
  exposure refresh and solver, which is the breakdown you want before optimising anything. See
  [telemetry.md](telemetry.md).
* **Auditing a dump:** `dotnet run --project Thermodynamics.Sim -- dump` reads the newest
  environment CSV out of the game's saves and checks it against the claims the model makes about
  itself — that the wind decomposes into the factors reported beside it, that convection is
  reported only where there is air, that a positive depth means a buried grid. `--path` names a
  folder or one CSV, `THERMAL_DUMPS` names a folder for good. Non-zero exit means a defect check
  failed; the counts against open questions are printed as observations and never fail. Columns a
  dump predates are skipped by name rather than passed silently.
* **Outside the game:** most questions are faster to answer in [`tests/`](../tests) —
  `dotnet test`, or `dotnet run --project Thermodynamics.Sim -- run perf` for throughput.

## Where to start when adding a feature

| Goal | Touch |
| --- | --- |
| New thermal property on blocks | `ThermalCellDefinition` and `BlockThermalProperties`, the copy in `ThermalBlockCatalog.ToThermalProperties`, then `Data/Cubes.xml` |
| New pipe or pump shape | `ThermalCoolantShapes`, a new SBC in `Data/CubeBlocks/`, an entry in `Cubes.xml`, and the block variant group. The table is linked into the test project, so add a case to `HostAdapterTests` |
| Change how heat moves between blocks | `ConductionBuilder` in `Core/Simulation/ThermalLink.cs` |
| Change environmental response | `EnvironmentSolver`, and `ThermalGrid.Sample` for what the world feeds it |
| Change what counts as exposed | `SurfaceMap.GetExposedFaces`, and `BlockSurfaceBuilder` for what a block declares |
| Change what the game tells a block | `ThermalBlock.Attach` |
| Per-block sun shadowing | `ThermalNode`'s directional weighting is the hook; the solver resolves the sun into six per-face weights once per step |
| New instrumentation | `ISimulationProfiler` for a stage, `GridTelemetry` for a figure, `TelemetryReport` for a row |
| Multiplayer sync | `SettingsSync` for anything the whole world shares, a `NetSync<T>` on the block's own component for anything one block owns, and `SettingsRequests` — on the engine's *secure* handler — for anything gated on who is asking. See [architecture.md](architecture.md#networking) |


## Publishing

**This repository is the mod folder.** It is linked into the game so a change is testable without
copying, which means everything sitting in it is part of what a workshop publish uploads. Two things
that are not mod content are therefore kept outside it deliberately, so that publishing needs no
cleanup step — and a cleanup step that has to be remembered is one that eventually is not.

| What | Where it lives | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Build output | `../ThermalDynamics.build/` | The game compiles `Data/Scripts` itself; the assemblies exist only for compile-checking and tests here. They were 394 MB. Set by [Directory.Build.props](../Directory.Build.props). |
| The blueprint corpus | `~/.local/share/thermal-dynamics/corpus` | Ten thousand of other people's ships is over a hundred gigabytes, and none of it belongs in a mod. Override with `THERMAL_CORPUS`. |

What remains is the mod and its tests:

```
Models      95 MB   .mwm block models
Textures    14 MB
Data       4.3 MB   definitions and every C# source file the game compiles
tests      2.8 MB   the isolated build, the suite and the balance lab
docs       736 KB
```

About 115 MB, plus `.git`. The test projects are kept in the tree on purpose — they are part of the
work, they are small, and the game ignores them.

**No credential is ever written into this tree.** The corpus fetcher takes a Steam Web API key from
the command line or the environment and redacts it from anything it prints; nothing writes it to a
file. The only personal data in the repository is the developer's own paths in `Generic.csproj`,
which should be parameterised the way [tests/Directory.Build.props](../tests/Directory.Build.props)
already parameterises the game location.

## Change log

| Date | Change |
| --- | --- |
| 2026-08-22 | Added the comment convention to [Documentation conventions](#documentation-conventions): a comment names a definition and points at the page that argues it, and the pointer is plain text rather than a relative markdown link, because a link inside a `.cs` renders nowhere and nothing checks it. Both of the two that existed had rotted. |
| 2026-08-22 | Corrected the multiplayer row, which said no commands were registered on the network channel; three replicated properties and a second secure channel exist. |
| 2026-08-22 | Added the standard header and this change log. The documentation conventions this repository follows are stated in [Documentation conventions](#documentation-conventions) below. |
| 2026-08-21 | Checked the documentation's own links and fixed the sixteen that were dead. |
| 2026-08-20 | Moved build output outside the mod folder, so the repository stays publishable with no cleanup step. Added auditing a field dump rather than reading one. |
| 2026-08-17 | Moved the readouts off Text HUD API onto Rich HUD, and recorded the dependency as optional. |
| 2026-08-12 | Opened the page on the rebuilt mod. |
