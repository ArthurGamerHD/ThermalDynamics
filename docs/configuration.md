# Configuration

Settings live in `ThermodynamicsConfig.cfg` in world storage, written with defaults the first time
a world loads and regenerated when `Version` does not match.

Every setting can also be changed while the world is running. A change is written into the settings
object every grid already holds and picked up on the next step: heat capacities are rescaled,
coolant loops and room air are rebuilt, and each mechanism reads its own switch. Nothing is written
to disk unless asked.

## Runtime control

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `/thermal status` | Collection state, sample stride, live grids, block models, bridges. |
| `/thermal settings` | Every setting and its current value. |
| `/thermal set <name> <value>` | Changes one setting for this session. Switches take `on`/`off` or `1`/`0`. |
| `/thermal save` | Writes the current values to the config file. |
| `/thermal overlay` | Cycles the block overlay. Same as Ctrl+Shift+=. |
| `/thermal menu` | Opens the settings menu. Same as Ctrl+Shift+-. |
| `/thermal telemetry on` / `off` | Starts and stops data collection. |
| `/thermal stride <n>` | Telemetry sample stride. |
| `/thermal dump` | Writes a telemetry report without closing the world. |

Settings are server side; `set` from a client is refused. The same names are reachable from other
mods — see [api.md](api.md#settings).

## The settings menu

**Ctrl+Shift+-** opens it, as does `/thermal menu`. It is built on the [Rich HUD
Framework](https://github.com/ZachHembree/RichHudFramework.Client) and needs the **Rich HUD Master**
mod (`1965654081`) to be enabled; without it the keystroke says so and the chat commands remain the
way in.

Every value in this file has a control there, grouped the way this page is: mechanisms, solver,
environment, heat pumps, presentation, telemetry. Switches are checkboxes, numbers are sliders with
a range chosen for what is worth dragging to, and each control carries the setting's description.
Changes apply to the running session immediately; **Save to config file** is what makes them
outlive it, and each category has a reset that puts it back to the shipped defaults.

The menu is generated from the same name list the chat commands and the mod API use, so a setting
added to the config file appears in it without anyone maintaining a second list. A setting the
menu's layout table does not describe still gets a control, under **Other**.

On a multiplayer client the simulation controls are visible but disabled, for the same reason
`set` is refused there: the config is world state and belongs to the server. The four presentation
switches stay editable, because they only change what that client draws.

## Mechanisms

Each switch removes exactly its own mechanism and its own cost.

| Setting | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EnableEnvironment` | `true` | Master switch for radiation and convection. |
| `EnableConduction` | `true` | Heat flow between touching blocks. |
| `EnableRadiation` | `true` | Radiative exchange with the ambient sky. |
| `EnableConvection` | `true` | Convective exchange with the surrounding air. |
| `EnableSolarHeat` | `true` | Solar gain and the sun occlusion raycast. |
| `EnableHeatSources` | `true` | Gain from point sources registered by other mods. |
| `EnableWasteHeat` | `true` | Heat from power production, power draw and thrust. |
| `EnablePlanets` | `true` | Planetary climate. Off means ambient is always `VacuumTemperature`. |
| `EnableFriction` | `true` | Aerodynamic heating at speed in atmosphere. |
| `EnableDamage` | `true` | Damage above a block's critical temperature. |
| `EnableCoolantLoops` | `true` | Coolant loop heat transport. |
| `EnableRoomAir` | `true` | Sealed rooms hold an air mass that couples their surfaces. |
| `EnableHeatPumps` | `true` | Heat pumps move heat against a gradient for an electrical cost. Off makes them ordinary blocks. |

## Solver

| Setting | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Frequency` | 4 | Solver steps per simulated second. The integration step is `1/Frequency`. |
| `SimulationSpeed` | 1 | Simulated seconds per real second, applied by running more steps rather than longer ones. Linear in CPU. |
| `HeatTimeScale` | 225 | How much faster than real physics heat moves. Divides every heat capacity. |
| `ClampConductionOvershoot` | `true` | Caps each exchange at the energy that equalises the pair. Off reproduces the original unbounded solver. |
| `DamageIsPerSecond` | `true` | Overheat damage per second of simulated time. Off applies it per step, which makes damage scale with `Frequency`. |

## Environment

| Setting | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VacuumTemperature` | 2.7 K | Ambient in space, and the floor for planetary ambient. |
| `SolarEnergy` | 1000 W/m² | Solar irradiance above the atmosphere. |
| `FrictionAtSpeedsAbove` | 50 m/s | Relative airspeed at which aerodynamic heating starts. |
| `FrictionScale` | 0.001 | Coefficient on the v³ friction term. |
| `RoomConvectionCoefficient` | 8 W/(m²·K) | Coupling between a room's air and the surfaces facing it. Lower than the planetary figure because room air is still. |
| `RoomAirDensity` | 1.225 kg/m³ | Air density in a fully pressurised room. |
| `SolarOcclusionInterval` | 12 | Solver steps between solar occlusion raycasts. The raycast is the most expensive thing a grid does and the sun moves slowly. |

## Heat pumps

The two ratings a heat pump has — how much heat it can move and how much electricity it can draw —
belong to the block and live in
[ThermalHeatPumpShapes](../Data/Scripts/Thermodynamics/Game/ThermalHeatPumpShapes.cs). What is
tunable here is the physics between them, which is the same for every pump in the world.

| Setting | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HeatPumpCarnotFraction` | 0.4 | How much of the Carnot limit a pump achieves, 0..1. A real domestic heat pump manages about 0.4; 1 would be a thermodynamically perfect machine. This one number is the whole balance of the block. |
| `HeatPumpMaxCoefficient` | 8 | Ceiling on the coefficient of performance. Carnot's figure runs to infinity as the two sides converge, and a real machine is limited by its compressor long before that. |

Raising the fraction does not change what a pump can do — the shape of the cost curve is Carnot's
and is not negotiable — only how far up it the block sits. Lowering the ceiling makes pumps
predictable near equilibrium at the cost of making cheap, small-gap cooling less rewarding.

## Presentation

All client side and all off by default.

| Setting | Default | Draws |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DebugTextOnScreen` | `false` | Crosshair readout: temperature, per-mechanism watts, block constants, environment, grid totals, room classification, raw surface bits. Switching it on also makes the solver record per-mechanism watts, which is not free. |
| `DebugSolarRaycast` | `false` | Draws the sun ray from each grid, white when lit and red when occluded. |
| `DebugWindRaycast` | `false` | Draws the relative wind vector. |
| `DebugBlockOverlay` | 0 | Which view the block overlay opens a session on: 0 off, 1 temperature, 2 solar watts, 3 exposed faces, 4 friction watts, 5 rooms. |

### The block overlay

**Ctrl+Shift+=** cycles it: off → temperature → solar watts → exposed faces → friction watts → rooms
→ off.
`/thermal overlay` does the same from chat. A mod cannot add a rebindable control, so the chord is
fixed; it is ignored while the chat box or a menu is open.

Every block of the grid you are controlling and the grid you are looking at is drawn as a translucent
box coloured by the selected value, using the same ramp as the HUD and the terminal. The whole grid,
at any distance: a debug view that faded out at some radius would read as a cold far end rather than
as an undrawn one. Only those two grids are picked up, which is what keeps the cost bounded. The boxes are drawn *through* the hull — a reactor buried mid-ship is visible from
outside, which is the point of a debug view and the reason this was a poor thermal camera.

**Solar watts** and **friction watts** are the per-mechanism figures the solver normally does not
bother to write down. Selecting either makes it record them for as long as that view is up, the same
way the crosshair readout does, and stop when you cycle past. Without that they would draw every
grid uniformly at zero, which reads as "no solar heating" rather than as "not measured".

**Rooms** is the one view that draws cells rather than blocks: a box in every cell the mapper put in
a room, coloured by which room it is, with vented rooms drawn faint. It is how you find out whether
two compartments you think are separate came back as one room, and where the leak is when a room you
think is sealed reads as vented — a question no readout answers, because rooms belong to cells and
readouts belong to blocks.

Everything about it is client side and per frame: nothing is written to the grid, nothing
replicates, and switching it off leaves no trace. It replaces the four `Debug*BlockColors` modes,
which called `MyCubeGrid.ColorBlocks` and showed heat by permanently overwriting every player's
paint. `DebugBlockOverlay` is a server-side setting like the rest of the file, so it only sets what
a session starts on — the keybind is how each client drives it.

## Telemetry

| Setting | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EnableTelemetry` | `false` | Session-long data collection. See [telemetry.md](telemetry.md). |
| `TelemetrySampleStride` | 4 | Fraction of each grid's blocks sampled per step for the per-definition statistics — `1/n`. Every block is still seen once per `n` steps. |

## Time and pace

Three settings affect pace and they do different things:

```
StepSeconds    = 1 / Frequency              simulated seconds in one solver step
StepsPerSecond = Frequency × SimulationSpeed
Capacity       = SpecificHeat × Mass / HeatTimeScale
```

* **`Frequency` is accuracy** — how finely a simulated second is integrated.
* **`SimulationSpeed` is how fast simulated time runs.** Honest, and linear in CPU.
* **`HeatTimeScale` is how fast heat moves within a simulated second.** Free in CPU terms, and the
  reason the definitions can carry real material values without a hull taking hours to cool.
  Dividing every capacity by *k* is exactly running thermal time at *k*×: every rate scales
  together, so equilibrium temperatures, the balance between mechanisms and the ratios between
  block types are all unchanged. Only the clock moves.

Total acceleration over real physics is `SimulationSpeed × HeatTimeScale`. The shipped 225 is what
makes steel's real 450 J/(kg·K) behave the way the old flat value of 2 did.

`HeatTimeScale` costs stability margin rather than time: higher values make the system stiffer, so
the solver takes more substeps. When a grid is stiff enough to hit the substep cap the telemetry
report says so.

Block tuning — conductivity, specific heat, critical temperatures — is not in this file. It lives in
the definition XML; see [definitions.md](definitions.md).
